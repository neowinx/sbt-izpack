# Change Log

Version 1.0.0

* Updated for SBT 0.13.x.

----

Version 0.3.4.2:

* One last attempt to fix Ivy-related dependency versioning problems. Seems to
  work from here.

----

Version 0.3.4.1:

* Republished again, for Ivy-related problems.

----

Version 0.3.4:

* Republished, largely to correct a problem in the Ivy files.
* Dropped support for Scala 2.9.0 and 2.9.0-1.

----

Version 0.3.3:

* Updated to SBT 0.12.
* Added Scala 2.9.2 to set of cross-built versions.
* Doug Tangren's (excellent) [ls](http://ls.implicit.ly/) SBT plugin is now
  specified directly in the project, to make it easier for others to build
  this plugin.

----

Version 0.3.2:

Fixed a `scala.MatchError`, arising from a match against an `ArrayBuffer`,
instead of a `List`. This error caused the installer to abort, during
generation of the XML, under certain circumstances.

----

Version 0.3.1:

* Fixed Ivy-related publishing issue.

----

Version 0.3:

* Updated to SBT 0.11.2.
* Added support for *ls.implicit.ly* metadata.

----

Version 0.2.1:

* `IzPack.izPackSettings` is now deprecated, in favor of just `IzPack.settings`.

----

Version 0.2:

*sbt-izpack* setting and task keys are already inside in inner `IzPack` object,
for namespace scoping. This revision adds a trick by [Josh Suereth][], to make
usage easier. Basically, the keys are now defined like this:

    object IzPack extends Plugin {
      object IzPack {
        val Config = config("izpack") extend(Runtime)

        val configFile = SettingKey[File]("config-file") in Config
        val installerJar = SettingKey[RichFile]("installer-jar") in Config
        ...
      }
    }

Putting the `in Config` after *each* setting or task changes the `build.sbt`
usage pattern from the clunky

    IzPack.configFile in IzPack <<= ...

to the far more deliciously appealing

    IzPack.configFile <<= ...

----

Version 0.1.4:

* Put plugin settings into a sub-object, so they don't clash with
  other settings on (auto) import into `build.sbt`. Accessing a setting
  is now accomplished with:

        IzPack.configFile in IzPack.Config <<= baseDirectory(...)

* Converted code to conform with standard Scala coding style.

----

Version 0.1.3:

* Renamed various plugin settings and variables, so their names wouldn't
  clash, on import, with other plugins.

----

Version 0.1.2:

* Default log level in *sbt-izpack* is now `Info`, not `Warn`.
* `(createXML in IzPack)` now depends on `(packageBin in Compile)`, so
  compilation will be triggered automatically, before the installer
  configuration is translated.
* `(createInstaller in IzPack)` now depends on `(createXML in IzPack)`.

----

Version 0.1.1:

* Fixed a problem with `logLevel` handling.
* `failureType` in an `executable` (within a `pack`) now defaults to
  `warn`. (It didn't have a default, but was required.)
* `stage` in an `executable` (within a `pack`) now defaults to
  `never`. (It didn't have a default, but was required.)
* Added missing `type` field to `executable` XML element.
* Now published for Scala 2.8.1, 2.9.0 and 2.9.0-1.
* Predefined variables now contain `$appName` (from SBT's `name` setting),
  `$normalizedAppName` (from SBT's `normalizedName` setting) `$appVersion`
  (from SBT's `version` setting), `$scalaVersion` and `$appJar` (the
  project's generated jar file) and `$classDirectory` (the directory
  containing the compiled classes and the jar file, from SBT's
  `classDirectory` setting).

----

Version 0.1:

Completely rewrote my SBT 0.7 [IzPack][] plugin for [SBT][] 0.10.x. Now
uses a YAML configuration file, rather than a [Scala][] DSL, for
configuration, resulting in a more compact (and, arguably, more readable)
configuration.
